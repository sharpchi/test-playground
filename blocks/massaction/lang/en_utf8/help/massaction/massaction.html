<h1>Mass Actions</h1>

<p>
This block allows instructors to perform actions upon 
multiple resources or activities in the class view, rather
than having to perform repeated actions on individual items.
</p>

<p>
To use this block, Javascript must be enabled in your
browser, you must be in editing mode in the course
home page, and Ajax must be disabled. Only the 
courses in the Week or Topics formats are supported.
</p>

<p>
Supported actions include mass deletion, mass hiding, 
mass showing, and mass moving. To select items to perform
actions on, simply click the checkbox to the right of it 
in the course home page, or you may select all items, 
or select all items in a section using the block.
To perform actions, click the action you would like to 
perform inside the block.
